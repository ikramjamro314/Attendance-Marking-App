Attendance Marking App

📌 Overview

The Attendance Marking App is designed to simplify and automate the process of recording student attendance. Instead of manually noting down attendance, this app allows users to efficiently store and manage records in a structured and hassle-free manner.

💡 Idea Behind the Project

As a Class Representative (CR), I observed that taking attendance manually was a tedious and inefficient task. Every lecture, I had to record student attendance in registers or spreadsheets, which was time-consuming and error-prone. It became clear that a digital solution was needed—something simple yet effective. This motivated me to create the Attendance Marking App to streamline the process and make attendance tracking easier for both students and teachers.
